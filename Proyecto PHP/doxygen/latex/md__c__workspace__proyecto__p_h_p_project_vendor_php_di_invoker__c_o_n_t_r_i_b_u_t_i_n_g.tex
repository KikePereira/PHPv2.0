First of all, {\bfseries{thank you}} for contributing!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews and merging\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item follow \href{http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/}{\texttt{ PSR-\/1}} and \href{http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/}{\texttt{ PSR-\/2}}
\item run the test suite
\item write (or update) unit tests when applicable
\item write documentation for new features
\item use \href{http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html}{\texttt{ commit messages that make sense}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

One may ask you to \href{http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html}{\texttt{ squash your commits}} too. This is used to \char`\"{}clean\char`\"{} your pull request before merging it (we don\textquotesingle{}t want commits such as {\ttfamily fix tests}, {\ttfamily fix 2}, {\ttfamily fix 3}, etc.).

When creating your pull request on Git\+Hub, please write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.
