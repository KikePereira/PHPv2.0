Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_slim}{Slim}} Framework 4 application. This application uses the latest \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_slim}{Slim}} 4 with \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_slim}{Slim}} PSR-\/7 implementation and PHP-\/\+DI container implementation. It also uses the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_monolog}{Monolog}} logger.

This skeleton application was built for \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_composer}{Composer}}. This makes setting up a new \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_slim}{Slim}} Framework application quick and easy.\hypertarget{md__c__workspace__proyecto__p_h_p_project__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Install the Application}\label{md__c__workspace__proyecto__p_h_p_project__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_slim}{Slim}} Framework application. You will require PHP 7.\+4 or newer.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{composer create-\/project slim/slim-\/skeleton [my-\/app-\/name]}

\end{DoxyCode}


Replace {\ttfamily \mbox{[}my-\/app-\/name\mbox{]}} with the desired directory name for your new application. You\textquotesingle{}ll want to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Point your virtual host document root to your new application\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily public/} directory.
\item Ensure {\ttfamily logs/} is web writable.
\end{DoxyItemize}

To run the application in development, you can run these commands


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd [my-\/app-\/name]}
\DoxyCodeLine{composer start}

\end{DoxyCode}


Or you can use {\ttfamily docker-\/compose} to run the app with {\ttfamily docker}, so you can run these commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd [my-\/app-\/name]}
\DoxyCodeLine{docker-\/compose up -\/d}

\end{DoxyCode}
 After that, open {\ttfamily \href{http://localhost:8080}{\texttt{ http\+://localhost\+:8080}}} in your browser.

Run this command in the application directory to run the test suite


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{composer test}

\end{DoxyCode}


That\textquotesingle{}s it! Now go build something cool.
